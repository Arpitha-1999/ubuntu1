 # Linux kernel


There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/Documentation/admin-guide">Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst</a> first.


In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
