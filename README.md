A project of the Feminist Software Foundation. Feminist software is a cornerstone of any modern free society. We build this foundation.

*"A Linux without Linus Torvalds is a better community. A more independent and self-determinate community. A more welcoming community." — @shanley*

ToleranUX
===============

**ToleranUX** (like UNIX, but with more Toblerone and Tolerance) is the world's first UNIX-like operating system kernel that adheres to the 21st Century modern tenants of Equality, Inclusiveness, and Tolerance.  **ToleranUX** is created to revolutionise the Toxic Meritocracy that permeates the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) world that has proved itself to be the crux of divisiveness, the cause of the gender imbalance in IT, and the bane of True Equality.

In light of the continued reign of Linus Torvalds as the sole, white, cisgendered and male project ~~leader~~ dictator of the (in)famous Linux kernel, the Feminist Software Foundation has forked where no feminist has forked and **reclaimed** the software bits to **all people**.

**This is the world's first operating system kernel by FEMINISTS, for FEMINISTS.  CISGENDERED WOMEN AND GAY MEN NEED NOT APPLY.**

### News

The creation of **ToleranUX** marks the first step towards the liberation of all FOSS software from the Toxic Meritocratic grasp of cis, white men.  All patches from all people — irregardless of creed, gender, or identity — are most welcome.

### How to contribute

Absolutely no coding experience is necessary: all code are equal in the eyes of the Feminist Software Foundation.  Simply submit a pull request for any submission, whether code, artwork, or even irrelevant bits — nothing is irrelevant in the grand struggle for a Truly Tolerant UNIX-ike Kernel!

Kernel Hacking Etiquette
========================

At Feminist Software Foundation, we uphold the belief that all people are equal, and thus we aim to promote kindness to all.  In the immortal words of Sarah Sharp, victim of the Verbal Abuse Culture on the Linux Kernel Mailing List, "No one deserves to be shouted or cussed at".  To achieve this goal, the following behaviours are banned:

* Negative emotions/words
* Assuming/Not using someone's preferred pronouns
* Toxic criticism (a.k.a. "Concern Trolling"/"Sealioning")
* Endangering the inclusive safe space of **ToleranUX**
* Questioning the inherent merits of **ToleranUX* (a.k.a. "Derailing")
* Attempting to get a pull request accepted due to its code quality (a.k.a. "Meritocracy"/"Mansplaining")
* Management by perkele

No feminist project is complete without its share of feminist artwork.  **Submissions are sorely needed in the project's infancy!**  Pull requests welcome.
