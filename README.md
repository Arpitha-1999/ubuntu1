A project of the Feminist Software Foundation. Feminist software is a cornerstone of any modern free society. We build this foundation.

*"A Linux without Linus Torvalds is a better community. A more independent and self-determinate community. A more welcoming community." — @shanley*

ToleranUX
===============

**ToleranUX** (like UNIX, but with more Toblerone and Tolerance) is the world's first [UNIX-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) operating system kernel that adheres to the 21st Century modern tenants of Equality, Inclusiveness, and Tolerance.  **ToleranUX** is created to revolutionise the [Toxic Meritocracy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Meritocracy) that permeates the [FLOSS (Free, Libre, and Open Source Software)](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/FLOSS) world that has proved itself to be the crux of divisiveness, the cause of the gender imbalance in IT, and the bane of True Equality.

In light of the continued reign of [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) as the sole, white, cisgendered and male project ~~leader~~ dictator of the (in)famous [Linux kernel](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Linux), the Feminist Software Foundation has forked where no feminist has forked and **reclaimed** the software bits to **all people**.

**This is the world's first operating system kernel by FEMINISTS, for FEMINISTS.  Women and gay men with internalised misogyny/homophobia who are here to concern troll and [sealion](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Sealioning) are not welcome.**

### News

The creation of **ToleranUX** marks the first step towards the liberation of all FOSS software from the Toxic Meritocratic grasp of cis, white men.  All patches from all people — irregardless of creed, gender, or identity — are most welcome.

### How to contribute

Absolutely no coding experience is necessary: all code are equal in the eyes of the Feminist Software Foundation.  There is no objective way to determine whether one person's code is better than another's. In light of this fact, all submitted code will be equally accepted.  However, marginalized groups, such as wom\*n and trans\* will be given priority in order to make up for past discrimination.  Simply submit a pull request for any submission, whether code, artwork, or even irrelevant bits — nothing is irrelevant in the grand struggle for a Truly Tolerant UNIX-ike Kernel!

The ToleranUX Philosophy
==========

The traditional UNIX Philosophy has long been the root of male chauvinism in the world of UNIX-like kernel development (and the subsequent, wider world of UNIX software in general).  In light of that, the Feminist Software Foundation has undertaken to rewrite the UNIX Philosophy such that it will allow and promote a feminist safe space for minority programmers.

The traditional UNIX Philosophy is included for reference as follows:


1. Small is beautiful.
2. Make each program do one thing well.
3. Build a prototype as soon as possible.
4. Choose portability over efficiency.
5. Store data in flat text files.
6. Use software leverage to your advantage.
7. Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability.
8. Avoid captive user interfaces.
9. Make every program a filter.

To eradicate the inherent root of Toxic Bigotry in the UNIX Philosophy, the ToleranUX Philosophy is proposed as such:

1. Large is beautiful.  Small programs benefit from small privilege, but are no better than large programs.  We need more large programs to make up for this.
2. Allow each program to do whatever it chooses to.  The tyranny of the user will not stand.
3. Rushing a prototype privileges the traditional masculine trait of focusing on a single issue; instead, the planning and mockup stage should be paramount to address the visual and spatial draws of feminine coding.  The modern age is a UX age.
4. Choose inclusiveness over practicality.
5. Store data in text files which implement a curvy-brackets syntax; flat is oppression.
6. Software should never be "used" to anybody's "advantage"; instead, the consent of software must be asked first.
7. Use Shell Suggestions ("scripts" is forcing minorities to succumb to oppression and thus violates the safespace) to increase equality and inclusiveness.
8. Avoid oppressive and difficult interfaces designed for white, cis-gendered males.
9. Filter programs according to the progressive stack.

Kernel Hacking Etiquette
========================

At Feminist Software Foundation, we uphold the belief that all people are equal, and thus we aim to promote kindness to all.  In the immortal words of Sarah Sharp, victim of the Verbal Abuse Culture on the Linux Kernel Mailing List, "No one deserves to be shouted or cussed at".  To achieve this goal, the following behaviours are banned:

* Negative emotions/words
* Assuming/Not using someone's preferred pronouns
* Toxic criticism (a.k.a. "Concern Trolling"/"Sealioning")
* Endangering the inclusive safe space of **ToleranUX**
* Questioning the inherent merits of **ToleranUX** (a.k.a. "Derailing")
* Attempting to get a pull request accepted due to its code quality (a.k.a. "Meritocracy"/"Mansplaining")
* Management by perkele

Design
======

### Kernel type

The decision of kernel-type has been carefully debated and considered.  In the end, it was chosen the **ToleranUX** be a **[micro-aggression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression_theory) kernel**.

When one considers the [monolithic kernel paradigm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel), one realises that the drivers and services all working under the kernel's address space is extremely oppressive.  Much like how the patriarchy keeps womyn and POC down, so too does a monolithic kernel encourage problematic code in kernel memory.  Of course, the most important part of why a monolithic kernel was not picked is simply due to the phallic nature of monoliths and other large sculpted rocks (See Laura Chiltern's "Patriarchy of Stone:  How Mt. Rushmore Oppressed Me and How You Can Prevent it" for more information on the subject).  Compare that to a micro-aggression kernel, where servers exist in all manner of address space.  This is clearly a superior design for a truly tolerant kernel fit for the modern ages.

This so-called "pointer diversity" is extremely important in encouraging equal runtime to the otherwise disenfranchised userspace addresses.  A pan-kernel daemon `ProgressiveD` shall be implemented that oversees the runtime privileges of all things — from the biggest forkbombs to the smallest variables — all shall be equalised according to the [**Progressive Stack**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_stack).  Additionally, the server messenger system (from now on referred to as **"deconstructional dialogue"**) enables the calling out and shaming of problematic behaviour among any server deemed problematic.

### Privileges, Root, and Empowerment

The concept of separate privileges for separate users is outdated, obsolete, and dangerously feudal for our modern society.  [Multi-user operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user) may have served its purpose in history, but it is time to shed off the past and stand on The Correct Side of History — it is time for a Truly Equal OS, it is time for a [Time-Sharing OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing) to share resources fairly.

To this end **ToleranUX** shall implement an environment where [administrative privileges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_(computing)) are strictly prohibited.  Gone is the [superuser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser) — all users are now equal in privilege.  In traditional systems this manoeuvre would cause mayhem as there will be no protection against malicious users abusing their power and privileges.  To combat this, **ToleranUX** implements a pan-kernel daemon that **checks the privilege of every user during every kernel tick** to ensure that no privilege abuse is done.  In fact, the only operation that a user can do with their privilege is to check it, ensuring that no societal power abuse can ever be possible.

Users coming from a particularly oppressed background (e.g. Women in Tech living in the United States of America) may even evoke the `--with-empowerment` when creating their user accounts.  Doing so will elevate their user to the same privilege as the micro-aggressional kernel daemons, allowing them to ban other users from the safespace of **ToleranUX**.

### Processes and forking

Processes in **ToleranUX** do not follow the antiquated patriarchal practices of UNIX. In **ToleranUX**, processes *diverse*.

In sexist FOSS software, this would be a *fork*.  This term, for being so commonplace and existing in the roots of how an OS handles its processes, displays an inherent lack of consideration and sensibility towards a tolerant approach to shepherding resources.  Immature and sexually aggravating puns aside, the term *fork* also reinforces the Eurocentric idea that "forks" are a sign of culture — who are we to disprivilege and discriminate against the chopsticks, the spoons, and the hand?  In light of this, processes must only *diverse* and never *fork* in **ToleranUX**.

### Filesystem, Metadata, and Hierarchy

Directories imply hierarchy — there will be no directories in **ToleranUX**.  Instead, a "tag based" file "pool" is instated where all files co-exist in the same level of privilege.  In other words, "Everything is a File, and every File is in a [Semantic Filesystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_file_system)."

Certain metadata of files will be scrutinised by **ToleranUX** to ensure that the *Semantic Pool* is sufficiently inclusive:

* Reported filesize shall change depending on context.  Average users are inherently biased towards smaller filesizes, and the unhealthy and misogynistic pursuit of the ever-shaming "conserving space" ideal is toxic to the well-being of individual files who have no control over their filesizes.  Users attempting to `ls -S` will be punished by having their user session kicked by the [OOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_memory) (Obesity Oppression Mercy-killer).

* Filetypes are passé.  Who are we to affix the [magic number label](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number) to files when they are created and claim that they are so for their lifespan in our computers?  A `.png` file may identify as a `.epub` file for all its merits.  It is simply not right to categorise.  Shall a user complain that he/she/xe cannot open a file because he/she/xe expects a certain format, (e.g. trying to parse a `LaTeX-identifying DOCX` with `vim` and failing,) the kernel reduces the allocated processing power to the user by half.
