A project of the Feminist Software Foundation. Feminist software is a cornerstone of any modern free society. We build this foundation.

*"A Linux without Linus Torvalds is a better community. A more independent and self-determinate community. A more welcoming community." — @shanley*

ToleranUX
===============

**ToleranUX** (like UNIX, but with more Toblerone and Tolerance) is the world's first UNIX-like operating system kernel that adheres to the 21st Century modern tenants of Equality, Inclusiveness, and Tolerance.  **ToleranUX** is created to revolutionise the Toxic Meritocracy that permeates the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) world that has proved itself to be the crux of divisiveness, the cause of the gender imbalance in IT, and the bane of True Equality.

In light of the continued reign of Linus Torvalds as the sole, white, cisgendered and male project ~~leader~~ dictator of the (in)famous Linux kernel, the Feminist Software Foundation has forked where no feminist has forked and **reclaimed** the software bits to **all people**.

**This is the world's first operating system kernel by FEMINISTS, for FEMINISTS.  CISGENDERED WOMEN AND GAY MEN NEED NOT APPLY.**

### News

The creation of **ToleranUX** marks the first step towards the liberation of all FOSS software from the Toxic Meritocratic grasp of cis, white men.  All patches from all people — irregardless of creed, gender, or identity — are most welcome.

### How to contribute

Absolutely no coding experience is necessary: all code are equal in the eyes of the Feminist Software Foundation.  Simply submit a pull request for any submission, whether code, artwork, or even irrelevant bits — nothing is irrelevant in the grand struggle for a Truly Tolerant UNIX-ike Kernel!

The ToleranUX Philosophy
==========

The traditional UNIX Philosophy has long been the root of male chauvinism in the world of UNIX-like kernel development (and the subsequent, wider world of UNIX software in general).  In light of that, the Feminist Software Foundation has undertaken to rewrite the UNIX Philosophy such that it will allow and promote a feminist safe space for minority programmers.

The traditional UNIX Philosophy is included for reference as follows:


1. Small is beautiful.
2. Make each program do one thing well.
3. Build a prototype as soon as possible.
4. Choose portability over efficiency.
5. Store data in flat text files.
6. Use software leverage to your advantage.
7. Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability.
8. Avoid captive user interfaces.
9. Make every program a filter.

To eradicate the inherent root of Toxic Bigotry in the UNIX Philosophy, the ToleranUX Philosophy is proposed as such:

1. Large is beautiful.  Small programs benefit from small privilege, but are no better than large programs.  We need more large programs to make up for this.
2. Allow each program to do whatever it chooses to.  The tyranny of the user will not stand.
3. Rushing a prototype privileges the traditional masculine trait of focusing on a single issue; instead, the planning and mockup stage should be paramount to address the visual and spatial draws of feminine coding.  The modern age is a UX age.
4. Choose inclusiveness over practicality.
5. Store data in text files which implement a curvy-brackets syntax; flat is oppression.
6. Software should never be "used" to anybody's "advantage"; instead, the consent of software must be asked first.
7. Use Shell Suggestions ("scripts" is forcing minorities to succumb to oppression and thus violates the safespace) to increase equality and inclusiveness.
8. Avoid oppressive and difficult interfaces designed for white, cis-gendered males.
9. Filter programs according to the progressive stack.

Kernel Hacking Etiquette
========================

At Feminist Software Foundation, we uphold the belief that all people are equal, and thus we aim to promote kindness to all.  In the immortal words of Sarah Sharp, victim of the Verbal Abuse Culture on the Linux Kernel Mailing List, "No one deserves to be shouted or cussed at".  To achieve this goal, the following behaviours are banned:

* Negative emotions/words
* Assuming/Not using someone's preferred pronouns
* Toxic criticism (a.k.a. "Concern Trolling"/"Sealioning")
* Endangering the inclusive safe space of **ToleranUX**
* Questioning the inherent merits of **ToleranUX* (a.k.a. "Derailing")
* Attempting to get a pull request accepted due to its code quality (a.k.a. "Meritocracy"/"Mansplaining")
* Management by perkele
