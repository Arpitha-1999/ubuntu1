# Linux kernel

## Welcome!
Welcome to the github repository for the Linux Kernel.

## About
There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, including HTML and PDF. Please read
the Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst file first.

In order to build the documentation, run the bash command  ``make htmldocs``
or ``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online [here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/).

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text Markup Notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements and information required for building and running the kernel,
along with information about the problems which may result by upgrading
your kernel. Thanks for looking at the words largest open source project!
