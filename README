## Linux Kernel Documentation Guide

The Linux kernel comes with comprehensive guides for both developers and users, available in various formats such as HTML and PDF. To get started, make sure to read the introductory document at `Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst`.

### Building the Documentation

To build the documentation in your preferred format, use the following commands:
- For HTML: `make htmldocs`
- For PDF: `make pdfdocs`

Alternatively, you can access the formatted documentation online at [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/).

### Documentation Directory

The `Documentation/` subdirectory contains numerous text files, many of which use reStructuredText (reST) markup. Key documents include:

- **README.rst**: Introductory guide for kernel developers and users.
- **process/changes.rst**: Essential information on the requirements for building and running the kernel, as well as potential issues that may arise during kernel upgrades.

Make sure to read these files to understand the necessary steps and precautions when working with the Linux kernel.
