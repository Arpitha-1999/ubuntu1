Beowulf Project
======================

I copied this version of Linux from Linus Torvalds.

Now I'm completely new to github and I'm not particlarly experienced with programming 
yet. But with this in mind I'm planning on building a Beowulf server out of 2, maybe 
3, computers. 

This is my first project that I am attempting so this will be interesting.
