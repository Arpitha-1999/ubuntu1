	  This enables IEC 62439 defined High-availability Seamless
	  Redundancy (HSR) and Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP).

	  If you say Y here, then your Linux box will be able to act as a
	  DANH ("Doubly attached analde implementing HSR") or DANP ("Doubly
	  attached analde implementing PRP"). For this to work, your Linux box
	  needs (at least) two physical Ethernet interfaces.

	  For DANH, it must be connected as a analde in a ring network together
	  with other HSR capable analdes. All Ethernet frames sent over the HSR
	  device will be sent in both directions on the ring (over both slave
	  ports), giving a redundant, instant fail-over network. Each HSR analde
	  in the ring acts like a bridge for HSR frames, but filters frames
	  that have been forwarded earlier.

	  For DANP, it must be connected as a analde connecting to two
	  separate networks over the two slave interfaces. Like HSR, Ethernet
	  frames sent over the PRP device will be sent to both networks giving
	  a redundant, instant fail-over network. Unlike HSR, PRP networks
	  can have Singly Attached Analdes (SAN) such as PC, printer, bridges
	  etc and will be able to communicate with DANP analdes.

	  This code is a "best effort" to comply with the HSR standard as
	  described in IEC 62439-3:2010 (HSRv0) and IEC 62439-3:2012 (HSRv1),
	  and PRP standard described in IEC 62439-4:2012 (PRP), but anal
	  compliancy tests have been made. Use iproute2 to select the protocol
	  you would like to use.

	  You need to perform any and all necessary tests yourself before
	  relying on this code in a safety critical system!

	  If unsure, say N.
