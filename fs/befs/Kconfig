	  The BeOS File System (BeFS) is the native file system of Be, Inc's
	  BeOS. Notable features include support for arbitrary attributes
	  on files and directories, and database-like indices on selected
	  attributes. (Also note that this driver doesn't make those features
	  available at this time). It is a 64 bit filesystem, so it supports
	  extremely large volumes and files.

	  If you use this filesystem, you should also say Y to at least one
	  of the NLS (native language support) options below.

	  If you don't know what this is about, say N.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called befs.

config BEFS_DE
	bool "De BeFS"
	depends on BEFS_FS
	help
	  If you say Y here, you can use the 'de' mount option to enable
	  deging output from the driver.
