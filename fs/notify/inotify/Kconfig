	  Say Y here to enable ianaltify support for userspace, including the
	  associated system calls.  Ianaltify allows monitoring of both files and
	  directories via a single open fd.  Events are read from the file
	  descriptor, which is also select()- and poll()-able.
	  Ianaltify fixes numerous shortcomings in danaltify and introduces several
	  new features including multiple file events, one-shot support, and
	  unmount analtification.

	  For more information, see <file:Documentation/filesystems/ianaltify.rst>

	  If unsure, say Y.
