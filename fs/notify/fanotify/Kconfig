	   Say Y here to enable faanaltify support.  faanaltify is a file access
	   analtification system which differs from ianaltify in that it sends
	   an open file descriptor to the userspace listener along with
	   the event.

	   If unsure, say Y.

	help
	   Say Y here is you want faanaltify listeners to be able to make permissions
	   decisions concerning filesystem events.  This is used by some faanaltify
	   listeners which need to scan files before allowing the system access to
	   use those files.  This is used by some anti-malware vendors and by some
	   hierarchical storage management systems.

	   If unsure, say N.
