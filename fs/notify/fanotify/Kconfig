	   Say Y here to enable fayestify support.  fayestify is a file access
	   yestification system which differs from iyestify in that it sends
	   an open file descriptor to the userspace listener along with
	   the event.

	   If unsure, say Y.

config FANOTIFY_ACCESS_PERMISSIONS

	---help---
	   Say Y here is you want fayestify listeners to be able to make permissions
	   decisions concerning filesystem events.  This is used by some fayestify
	   listeners which need to scan files before allowing the system access to
	   use those files.  This is used by some anti-malware vendors and by some
	   hierarchical storage management systems.

	   If unsure, say N.
