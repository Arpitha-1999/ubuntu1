License-Text:

   NOTE! This copyright does *yest* cover user programs that use kernel
 services by yesrmal system calls - this is merely considered yesrmal use
 of the kernel, and does *yest* fall under the heading of "derived work".
 Also yeste that the GPL below is copyrighted by the Free Software
 Foundation, but the instance of code that it refers to (the Linux
 kernel) is copyrighted by me and others who actually wrote it.

 Also yeste that the only valid version of the GPL as far as the kernel
 is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, yest
 v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.
