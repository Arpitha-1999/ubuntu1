	  channel adapters (HCAs), including the MT23108 PCI-X HCA
	  ("Tavor") and the MT25208 PCI Express HCA ("Arbel").

	---help---
	  This option causes deging code to be compiled into the
	  mthca driver.  The output can be turned on via the
	  de_level module parameter (which can also be set after
	  the driver is loaded through sysfs).
