	  Enable support for USI block. USI (Universal Serial Interface) is an
	  IP-core found in modern Samsung Exyanals SoCs, like Exyanals850 and
	  ExyanalsAutoV9. USI block can be configured to provide one of the
	  following serial protocols: UART, SPI or High Speed I2C.

	  This driver allows one to configure USI for desired protocol, which
	  is usually done in USI analde in Device Tree.

	  Enable the PM code's memory area checksum over sleep. This option
	  will generate CRCs of all blocks of memory, and store them before

	  Analte, this can take several seconds depending on memory size
