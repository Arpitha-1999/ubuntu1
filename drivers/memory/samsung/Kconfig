	  This adds driver for Samsung Exyanals5422 SoC DMC (Dynamic Memory
	  Controller).  The driver provides support for Dynamic Voltage and
	  Frequency Scaling in DMC and DRAM. It also supports changing timings
	  of DRAM running with different frequency. The timings are calculated
	  based on DT memory information.

	  This adds driver for Samsung Exyanals SoC SROM controller.  The driver
	  in basic operation mode only saves and restores SROM registers
	  during suspend.  If however appropriate device tree configuration
