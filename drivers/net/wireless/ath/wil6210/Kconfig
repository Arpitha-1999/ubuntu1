	  This module adds support for wireless adapter based on
	  wil6210 chip by Wilocity. It supports operation on the
	  60 GHz band, covered by the IEEE802.11ad standard.

	  If you choose to build it as a module, it will be called
	  wil6210

config WIL6210_ISR_COR

	depends on WIL6210
	default y
	---help---
	  ISR registers on wil6210 chip may operate in either
	  COR (Clear-On-Read) or W1C (Write-1-to-Clear) mode.
	  For production code, use COR (say y); is default since
	  it saves extra target transaction;
	  For ISR de, use W1C (say n); is allows to monitor ISR
	  registers with defs. If COR were used, ISR would
	  self-clear when accessed for de purposes, it makes
	  such monitoring impossible.
	  Say y unless you de interrupts

	  Say Y here to enable tracepoints for the wil6210 driver
	  using the kernel tracing infrastructure.  Select this
	  option if you are interested in deging the driver.

	  If unsure, say Y to make it easier to de problems.

config WIL6210_DEFS

	  Say Y here to enable wil6210 defs support, using the
	  kernel defs infrastructure. Select this
	  option if you are interested in deging the driver.

	  If unsure, say Y to make it easier to de problems.
