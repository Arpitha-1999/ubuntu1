	  This enables the AppArmor security module.

config SECURITY_APPARMOR_HASH
	bool "Enable introspection of sha1 hashes for loaded profiles"
	depends on SECURITY_APPARMOR
	select CRYPTO
	select CRYPTO_SHA1
	default y
	help
	  This option selects whether introspection of loaded policy
	  is available to userspace via the apparmor filesystem.

config SECURITY_APPARMOR_HASH_DEFAULT
       bool "Enable policy hash introspection by default"
       depends on SECURITY_APPARMOR_HASH
       default y
       help
         This option selects whether sha1 hashing of loaded policy
	 is enabled by default. The generation of sha1 hashes for
	 loaded policy provide system administrators a quick way
	 to verify that policy in the kernel matches what is expected,
	 however it can slow down policy load on some devices. In
	 these cases policy hashing can be disabled by default and
	 enabled only if needed.

config SECURITY_APPARMOR_DE
	bool "Build AppArmor with de code"
	depends on SECURITY_APPARMOR
	default n
	help
	  Build apparmor with deging logic in apparmor. Not all
	  deging logic will necessarily be enabled. A submenu will
	  provide fine grained control of the de options that are
	  available.

config SECURITY_APPARMOR_DE_ASSERTS
	bool "Build AppArmor with deging asserts"
	depends on SECURITY_APPARMOR_DE
	default y
	help
	  Enable code assertions made with AA_. These are primarily
	  function entry preconditions but also exist at other key
	  points. If the assert is triggered it will trigger a WARN
	  message.

config SECURITY_APPARMOR_DE_MESSAGES
	bool "De messages enabled by default"
	depends on SECURITY_APPARMOR_DE
	default n
	help
	  Set the default value of the apparmor.de kernel parameter.
	  When enabled, various de messages will be logged to
	  the kernel message buffer.
