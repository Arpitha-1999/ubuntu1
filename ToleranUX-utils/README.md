Initial implementation of `ToleranUX-coreutils`
===============================================

**ToleranUX**'s `coreutils` will ultimately be a re-appropriation of either the GNU `coreutils`, the Busybox utils, or `gentils`.  Until that work is done, here is a stop-gap measure to sooth our sensibilities.

1. Put `.toleranuxrc` into your home directory.
2. Run `source ~/.toleranuxrc`.
3. Enjoy your Tolerance.
