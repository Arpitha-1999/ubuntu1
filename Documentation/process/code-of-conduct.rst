---Pledge---

In the interest of fostering an effective, efficient, and constructive environment to further the advancement of the Linux kernel, we as contributors, maintainers, and involved users of said kernel (in whole the "community") pledge to remain topic focused and to view contributions without bias towards the contribution's origins, both of the person having designed the code, be it a physical, social, or mental condition, nor of the method of conception of the contribution, whether that's modification of existing libre and free resources, reuse of effective code, or entirely self-designed and self-tested documentation.

---Standards---

In an effort to keep the conversation surrounding the kernel about bettering the kernel itself, the following principles will be upheld:

1 - Any and all "ad hominem" attacks by *any* contributor can and will be disciplined, by methods including but not limited to suspension of contribution to the kernel and removal or closing of the relevent commits, code, wiki edits, and issues. Relevancy is determined through a simple process by which the infringing examples are designated, and those deemed more infringement than use are removed.

2 - Criticism shall remain constructive, if heated, and shall be applied to the contributions and codebase, and not to the person's physical, social, or mental condition. No contributor shall stand above another in a bureaucratic heirarchy, and all actions of discipline shall be taken based on severity by community-elected "moderators", whom, outside of disciplinary hearing, are not to be considered superior or senior to normal contributors.

3 - "Moderators" shall be elected by the community via a vote based on merit and consistent contributions to the kernel proper, and by no further means. No person shall be discriminated against based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or other physical, social, or mental conditions. By this manner, the kernel will be moderated by those who assist the kernel the most, and not by any other facet. "Moderators" can, and likely will, be a part of the Linux Foundation Technical Advisory Board, but involvement in the TAB is neither a necessity nor a requirement for "moderator" status.

4 - In instances where moderators may abuse their power, the remaining moderators, a vote of the LF-TAB, or a request by the community at large, may remove their access to moderation capability.

# - Kernel suspension shall not last longer than a term of one (1) year beyond the date of infraction. This stands in place not as a punishment, but for the purpose of forcing a cooling period such that peace and civility may remain.

---Responsibilities---

Contributors are responsible for their attitude as displayed on github.com/torvalds/linux, its subdirectories, and the Linux Kernel Mailing List, and any disciplinary action will be taken based on the statements made by contributors only on github.com/torvalds/linux, its various subdirectories, and the Linux Kernel Mailing List. Statements made outside the aformentioned locations, including emails, social media, and statements made in person between individuals, are not to be considered for potential disciplinary action and should instead be taken up with the administration of the platform used, whether that consists of social media moderators, event moderators, or email platforms.

Moderators are responsible for remaining a consistent and competent contributor to the Linux kernel, and to make fair and even judgement calls based on the actions of contributors as they stand currently. Moderators are not to overstep their bounds, nor to attempt to use their position to sway the community in their favor.

---Scope---

As previously mentioned, this Code of Conduct applies solely within github.com/torvalds/linux, its various subdirectories, and the Linux Kernel Mailing List, except where this may be embedded in another project as example.

#To All Future Users: Recommend updating this to fit your project, if this document is taken as example for it. 

---Enforcement---

As previously mentioned, enforcement of Standards and Responsiblity shall be handled by community-elected moderators, and punishment can include but is not limited to removal of contributions in issues, pull requests, and other areas, as well as temporary suspension of kernel contribution rights for up to a year, at the moderator's discretion.

Upon implementation, this Code of Conduct shall not retroactively affect any contributor, and shall only affect actions made after the date of implementation, as written here: [Insert date of Implementation here].

---Attribution---

This Code of Conduct was drafted by "SteveHeist" on Thursday, the 20th of September, to present as an alternative to the Code of Conduct adapted from the Contributor Covenant, which he believed to be written against the common interests of the contributors and the kernel, as evidenced by pull requests such as #593.

---Adjustment---

Adjustment of this Code of Conduct, after implementation, can be made by suggesting as such in Issues, and at the discretion of community-elected moderators. Before implementation, this Code of Conduct can be adjusted and fitted as seen fit by the community at large, such that it will serve the entire community, rather than any interests against them.

After the suggestion is agreed upon, it will be amended below these last lines, under the "Amendments" header, and shall enact itself accordingly.
