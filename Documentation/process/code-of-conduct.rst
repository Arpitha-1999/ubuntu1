Caveman's Code of Conduct
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We just want a better kernel every time.  A kernel is better if it makes neckbeards
happier.

Here are the rules:

  * Stay on-topic.  If you think someone is e-harassing your ass, please fuck off
    and discuss it in pornhub.com or whatever trashbin.  We are not interested in
    hearing lectures about e-sex and e-harassment.  We discuss how to make the 
    kernel better. Period.

  * Only men can contribute.  A woman can contribute only after obtaining 
    permission from her husband, her child (if she is a mother), and gets endorsed 
    by a man developer.

    Unless the cost of giving opportunities to people is zero, or that people are all
    equal, it is necessarily sub-optimal resource allocation to grant all people
    equal opportunities.  

If you disagree with reality, please get educated.  Alternatively, move your ass
to another universe where statistical observations are inline with your 
intuition.
