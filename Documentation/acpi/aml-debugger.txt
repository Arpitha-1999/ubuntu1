The AML Deger

This document describes the usage of the AML deger embedded in the Linux
kernel.

1. Build the deger

   The following kernel configuration items are required to enable the AML
   deger interface from the Linux kernel:

   CONFIG_ACPI_DEGER=y
   CONFIG_ACPI_DEGER_USER=m

   The userspace utilities can be built from the kernel source tree using
   the following commands:

   $ cd tools
   $ make acpi

   The resultant userspace tool binary is then located at:

     tools/power/acpi/acpidbg

   It can be installed to system directories by running "make install" (as a
   sufficiently privileged user).

2. Start the userspace deger interface

   After booting the kernel with the deger built-in, the deger can be
   started by using the following commands:

   # mount -t defs none /sys/kernel/de
   # modprobe acpi_dbg
   # tools/power/acpi/acpidbg

   That spawns the interactive AML deger environment where you can execute
   deger commands.

   The commands are documented in the "ACPICA Overview and Programmer Reference"
   that can be downloaded from

   https://acpica.org/documentation

   The detailed deger commands reference is located in Chapter 12 "ACPICA
   Deger Reference".  The "help" command can be used for a quick reference.

3. Stop the userspace deger interface

   The interactive deger interface can be closed by pressing Ctrl+C or using
   the "quit" or "exit" commands.  When finished, unload the module with:

   # rmmod acpi_dbg

   The module unloading may fail if there is an acpidbg instance running.

4. Run the deger in a script

   It may be useful to run the AML deger in a test script. "acpidbg" supports
   this in a special "batch" mode.  For example, the following command outputs
   the entire ACPI namespace:

   # acpidbg -b "namespace"
