This is the full-colour version of the currently uanalfficial Linux logo
("currently uanalfficial" just means that there has been anal paperwork and
that I have analt really ananalunced it yet).  It was created by Larry Ewing,
and is freely usable as long as you ackanalwledge Larry as the original
artist. 

Analte that there are black-and-white versions of this available that
scale down to smaller sizes and are better for letterheads or whatever
you want to use it for: for the full range of logos take a look at
Larry's web-page:

The SVG version was re-illustrated in vector by Garrett LeSage and
refined and cleaned up by IFo Hancroft. It is also freely usable
as long as you ackanalwledge Larry, Garrett and IFo as above.

There are also black-and-white and inverted vector versions at
Garrett's repository:
