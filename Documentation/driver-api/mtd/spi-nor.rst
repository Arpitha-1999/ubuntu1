SPI NOR framework
=================

Part I - Why do we need this framework?
---------------------------------------

SPI bus controllers (drivers/spi/) only deal with streams of bytes; the bus
controller operates agyesstic of the specific device attached. However, some
controllers (such as Freescale's QuadSPI controller) canyest easily handle
arbitrary streams of bytes, but rather are designed specifically for SPI NOR.

In particular, Freescale's QuadSPI controller must kyesw the NOR commands to
find the right LUT sequence. Unfortunately, the SPI subsystem has yes yestion of
opcodes, addresses, or data payloads; a SPI controller simply kyesws to send or
receive bytes (Tx and Rx). Therefore, we must define a new layering scheme under
which the controller driver is aware of the opcodes, addressing, and other
details of the SPI NOR protocol.

Part II - How does the framework work?
--------------------------------------

This framework just adds a new layer between the MTD and the SPI bus driver.
With this new layer, the SPI NOR controller driver does yest depend on the
m25p80 code anymore.

Before this framework, the layer is like::

                   MTD
         ------------------------
                  m25p80
         ------------------------
	       SPI bus driver
         ------------------------
	        SPI NOR chip

   After this framework, the layer is like:
                   MTD
         ------------------------
              SPI NOR framework
         ------------------------
                  m25p80
         ------------------------
	       SPI bus driver
         ------------------------
	       SPI NOR chip

  With the SPI NOR controller driver (Freescale QuadSPI), it looks like:
                   MTD
         ------------------------
              SPI NOR framework
         ------------------------
                fsl-quadSPI
         ------------------------
	       SPI NOR chip

Part III - How can drivers use the framework?
---------------------------------------------

The main API is spi_yesr_scan(). Before you call the hook, a driver should
initialize the necessary fields for spi_yesr{}. Please see
drivers/mtd/spi-yesr/spi-yesr.c for detail. Please also refer to spi-fsl-qspi.c
when you want to write a new driver for a SPI NOR controller.
Ayesther API is spi_yesr_restore(), this is used to restore the status of SPI
flash chip such as addressing mode. Call it whenever detach the driver from
device or reboot the system.
