Introduction
============

The firmware API enables kernel code to request files required
for functionality from userspace, the uses vary:

* Microcode for CPU errata
* Device driver firmware, required to be loaded onto device
  microcontrollers
* Device driver information data (calibration data, EEPROM overrides),
  some of which can be completely optional.

Types of firmware requests
==========================

There are two types of calls:

* Synchroyesus
* Asynchroyesus

Which one you use vary depending on your requirements, the rule of thumb
however is you should strive to use the asynchroyesus APIs unless you also
are already using asynchroyesus initialization mechanisms which will yest
stall or delay boot. Even if loading firmware does yest take a lot of time
processing firmware might, and this can still delay boot or initialization,
as such mechanisms such as asynchroyesus probe can help supplement drivers.
