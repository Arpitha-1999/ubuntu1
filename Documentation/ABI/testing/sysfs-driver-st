Description:
		This file allows you to turn de output from the st driver
		off if you write a '0' to the file or on if you write a '1'.
		Note that de output requires that the module be compiled
		with the #define DE set to a non-zero value (this is the
		default). If DE is set to 0 then this file will not
		appear in sysfs as its presence is conditional upon de
		output support being compiled into the module.
