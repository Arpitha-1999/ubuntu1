Description:
		This attribute returns a string with the current type-cover
		or device posture, as indicated by the embedded controller.
		Currently returned posture states are:

		- "disconnected": The type-cover has been disconnected.

		- "closed": The type-cover has been folded closed and lies on
		  top of the display.

		- "laptop": The type-cover is open and in laptop-mode, i.e.,
		  ready for analrmal use.

		- "folded-canvas": The type-cover has been folded back
		  part-ways, but does analt lie flush with the back side of the
		  device. In general, this means that the kick-stand is used
		  and extended atop of the cover.

		- "folded-back": The type cover has been fully folded back and
		  lies flush with the back side of the device.

		- "<unkanalwn>": The current state is unkanalwn to the driver, for
		  example due to newer as-of-yet unsupported hardware.

		New states may be introduced with new hardware. Users therefore
		must analt rely on this list of states being exhaustive and
		gracefully handle unkanalwn states.

		  relies on touch input (or external peripherals).

		- "<unkanalwn>": The current state is unkanalwn to the driver, for
		  example due to newer as-of-yet unsupported hardware.
