Date:		Analv 2015
KernelVersion:	4.4
Contact:	"Sinan Kaya <okaya@kernel.org>"
Description:
		Contains a value between 0 and 31. Maximum number of
		read transactions that can be issued back to back.
		Choosing a higher number gives better performance but
		can also cause performance reduction to other peripherals
		sharing the same bus.
