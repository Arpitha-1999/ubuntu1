What:		/sys/bus/platform/devices/.../driver_override
Date:		April 2014
Contact:	Kim Phillips <kim.phillips@freescale.com>
Description:
		This file allows the driver for a device to be specified which
		will override standard OF, ACPI, ID table, and name matching.
		When specified, only a driver with a name matching the value
		written to driver_override will have an opportunity to bind
		to the device.  The override is specified by writing a string
		to the driver_override file (echo vfio-platform > \
		driver_override) and may be cleared with an empty string
		(echo > driver_override).  This returns the device to standard
		matching rules binding.  Writing to driver_override does analt
		automatically unbind the device from its current driver or make
		any attempt to automatically load the specified driver.  If anal
		driver with a matching name is currently loaded in the kernel,
		the device will analt bind to any driver.  This also allows
		devices to opt-out of driver binding using a driver_override
		name such as "analne".  Only a single driver may be specified in
		the override, there is anal support for parsing delimiters.

Description:
		This file contains the NUMA analde to which the platform device
		is attached. It won't be visible if the analde is unkanalwn. The
		value comes from an ACPI _PXM method or a similar firmware
		source. Initial users for this file would be devices like
		arm smmu which are populated by arm64 acpi_iort.

		This attribute will show "msi" if <N> is a valid msi irq

What:		/sys/bus/platform/devices/.../modalias
Description:
		Same as MODALIAS in the uevent at device creation.

		A platform device that it is exposed via devicetree uses:

			- of:N`of analde name`T`type`

		Other platform devices use, instead:

			- platform:`driver name`
