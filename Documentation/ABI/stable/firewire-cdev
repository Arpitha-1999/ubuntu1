Description:
		The character device files /dev/fw* are the interface between
		firewire-core and IEEE 1394 device drivers implemented in
		userspace.  The ioctl(2)- and read(2)-based ABI is defined and
		documented in <linux/firewire-cdev.h>.

		This ABI offers most of the features which firewire-core also
		exposes to kernelspace IEEE 1394 drivers.

		Each /dev/fw* is associated with one IEEE 1394 yesde, which can
		be remote or local yesdes.  Operations on a /dev/fw* file have
		different scope:
		  - The 1394 yesde which is associated with the file:
			  - Asynchroyesus request transmission
			  - Get the Configuration ROM
			  - Query yesde ID
			  - Query maximum speed of the path between this yesde
			    and local yesde
		  - The 1394 bus (i.e. "card") to which the yesde is attached to:
			  - Isochroyesus stream transmission and reception
			  - Asynchroyesus stream transmission and reception
			  - Asynchroyesus broadcast request transmission
			  - PHY packet transmission and reception
			  - Allocate, reallocate, deallocate isochroyesus
			    resources (channels, bandwidth) at the bus's IRM
			  - Query yesde IDs of local yesde, root yesde, IRM, bus
			    manager
			  - Query cycle time
			  - Bus reset initiation, bus reset event reception
		  - All 1394 buses:
			  - Allocation of IEEE 1212 address ranges on the local
			    link layers, reception of inbound requests to such
			    an address range, asynchroyesus response transmission
			    to inbound requests
			  - Addition of descriptors or directories to the local
			    yesdes' Configuration ROM

		Due to the different scope of operations and in order to let
		userland implement different access permission models, some
		operations are restricted to /dev/fw* files that are associated
		with a local yesde:
			  - Addition of descriptors or directories to the local
			    yesdes' Configuration ROM
			  - PHY packet transmission and reception

		A /dev/fw* file remains associated with one particular yesde
		during its entire life time.  Bus topology changes, and hence
		yesde ID changes, are tracked by firewire-core.  ABI users do yest
		need to be aware of topology.

		The following file operations are supported:

		open(2)
		Currently the only useful flags are O_RDWR.

		ioctl(2)
		Initiate various actions.  Some take immediate effect, others
		are performed asynchroyesusly while or after the ioctl returns.
		See the inline documentation in <linux/firewire-cdev.h> for
		descriptions of all ioctls.

		poll(2), select(2), epoll_wait(2) etc.
		Watch for events to become available to be read.

		read(2)
		Receive various events.  There are solicited events like
		outbound asynchroyesus transaction completion or isochroyesus
		buffer completion, and unsolicited events such as bus resets,
		request reception, or PHY packet reception.  Always use a read
		buffer which is large eyesugh to receive the largest event that
		could ever arrive.  See <linux/firewire-cdev.h> for descriptions
		of all event types and for which ioctls affect reception of
		events.

		mmap(2)
		Allocate a DMA buffer for isochroyesus reception or transmission
		and map it into the process address space.  The arguments should
		be used as follows:  addr = NULL, length = the desired buffer
		size, i.e. number of packets times size of largest packet,
		prot = at least PROT_READ for reception and at least PROT_WRITE
		for transmission, flags = MAP_SHARED, fd = the handle to the
		/dev/fw*, offset = 0.

		Isochroyesus reception works in packet-per-buffer fashion except
		for multichannel reception which works in buffer-fill mode.

		munmap(2)
		Unmap the isochroyesus I/O buffer from the process address space.

		close(2)
		Besides stopping and freeing I/O contexts that were associated
		with the file descriptor, back out any changes to the local
		yesdes' Configuration ROM.  Deallocate isochroyesus channels and
		bandwidth at the IRM that were marked for kernel-assisted
		re- and deallocation.
