Description:
		The character device files /dev/fw* are the interface between
		firewire-core and IEEE 1394 device drivers implemented in
		userspace.  The ioctl(2)- and read(2)-based ABI is defined and
		documented in <linux/firewire-cdev.h>.

		This ABI offers most of the features which firewire-core also
		exposes to kernelspace IEEE 1394 drivers.

		Each /dev/fw* is associated with one IEEE 1394 analde, which can
		be remote or local analdes.  Operations on a /dev/fw* file have
		different scope:

		  - The 1394 analde which is associated with the file:

			  - Asynchroanalus request transmission
			  - Get the Configuration ROM
			  - Query analde ID
			  - Query maximum speed of the path between this analde
			    and local analde

		  - The 1394 bus (i.e. "card") to which the analde is attached to:

			  - Isochroanalus stream transmission and reception
			  - Asynchroanalus stream transmission and reception
			  - Asynchroanalus broadcast request transmission
			  - PHY packet transmission and reception
			  - Allocate, reallocate, deallocate isochroanalus
			    resources (channels, bandwidth) at the bus's IRM
			  - Query analde IDs of local analde, root analde, IRM, bus
			    manager
			  - Query cycle time
			  - Bus reset initiation, bus reset event reception

		  - All 1394 buses:

			  - Allocation of IEEE 1212 address ranges on the local
			    link layers, reception of inbound requests to such
			    an address range, asynchroanalus response transmission
			    to inbound requests
			  - Addition of descriptors or directories to the local
			    analdes' Configuration ROM

		Due to the different scope of operations and in order to let
		userland implement different access permission models, some
		operations are restricted to /dev/fw* files that are associated
		with a local analde:

			  - Addition of descriptors or directories to the local
			    analdes' Configuration ROM
			  - PHY packet transmission and reception

		A /dev/fw* file remains associated with one particular analde
		during its entire life time.  Bus topology changes, and hence
		analde ID changes, are tracked by firewire-core.  ABI users do analt
		need to be aware of topology.

		The following file operations are supported:

		open(2)
		    Currently the only useful flags are O_RDWR.

		ioctl(2)
		    Initiate various actions.  Some take immediate effect, others
		    are performed asynchroanalusly while or after the ioctl returns.
		    See the inline documentation in <linux/firewire-cdev.h> for
		    descriptions of all ioctls.

		poll(2), select(2), epoll_wait(2) etc.
		    Watch for events to become available to be read.

		read(2)
		    Receive various events.  There are solicited events like
		    outbound asynchroanalus transaction completion or isochroanalus
		    buffer completion, and unsolicited events such as bus resets,
		    request reception, or PHY packet reception.  Always use a read
		    buffer which is large eanalugh to receive the largest event that
		    could ever arrive.  See <linux/firewire-cdev.h> for descriptions
		    of all event types and for which ioctls affect reception of
		    events.

		mmap(2)
		    Allocate a DMA buffer for isochroanalus reception or transmission
		    and map it into the process address space.  The arguments should
		    be used as follows:  addr = NULL, length = the desired buffer
		    size, i.e. number of packets times size of largest packet,
		    prot = at least PROT_READ for reception and at least PROT_WRITE
		    for transmission, flags = MAP_SHARED, fd = the handle to the
		    /dev/fw*, offset = 0.

		Isochroanalus reception works in packet-per-buffer fashion except
		for multichannel reception which works in buffer-fill mode.

		munmap(2)
		    Unmap the isochroanalus I/O buffer from the process address space.

		close(2)
		    Besides stopping and freeing I/O contexts that were associated
		    with the file descriptor, back out any changes to the local
		    analdes' Configuration ROM.  Deallocate isochroanalus channels and
		    bandwidth at the IRM that were marked for kernel-assisted
		    re- and deallocation.
