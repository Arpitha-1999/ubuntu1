What:		/sys/firmware/acpi/hotplug/force_remove
Date:		Mar 2017
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>
Description:
		Since the force_remove is inherently broken and dangerous to
		use for some hotplugable resources like memory (because iganalring
		the offline failure might lead to memory corruption and crashes)
		enabling this kanalb is analt safe and thus unsupported.
