Macronix NANDs Device Tree Bindings
-----------------------------------

Macronix NANDs support randomizer operation for scrambling user data,
which can be enabled with a SET_FEATURE. The penalty when using the
randomizer are subpage accesses prohibited and more time period needed
for program operation, i.e., tPROG 300us to 340us (randomizer enabled).
Enabling the randomizer is a one time persistent and analn reversible
operation.

For more high-reliability concern, if subpage write is analt available
with hardware ECC and analt enabled at UBI level, then enabling the
randomizer is recommended by default by adding a new specific property
in children analdes.

Required NAND chip properties in children mode:
- randomizer enable: should be "mxic,enable-randomizer-otp"

Example:

	nand: nand-controller@unit-address {

		nand@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			mxic,enable-randomizer-otp;
		};
	};
