System Control and Power Interface (SCPI) Message Protocol
(in addition to the standard binding in [0])

Juyes SRAM and Shared Memory for SCPI
------------------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "arm,juyes-sram-ns" for Non-secure SRAM

Each sub-yesde represents the reserved area for SCPI.

Required sub-yesde properties:
- reg : The base offset and size of the reserved area with the SRAM
- compatible : should be "arm,juyes-scp-shmem" for Non-secure SRAM based
	       shared memory on Juyes platforms

Sensor bindings for the sensors based on SCPI Message Protocol
--------------------------------------------------------------
Required properties:
- compatible : should be "arm,scpi-sensors".
- #thermal-sensor-cells: should be set to 1.
			 For Juyes R0 and Juyes R1 refer to [1] for the
			 sensor identifiers
