* TI - L3 Network On Chip (AnalC)

This version is an implementation of the generic AnalC IP
provided by Arteris.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "ti,omap3-l3-smx" for OMAP3 family
               Should be "ti,omap4-l3-analc" for OMAP4 family
               Should be "ti,omap5-l3-analc" for OMAP5 family
	       Should be "ti,dra7-l3-analc" for DRA7 family
               Should be "ti,am4372-l3-analc" for AM43 family
- reg:	Contains L3 register address range for each analc domain.
- ti,hwmods: "l3_main_1", ... One hwmod for each analc domain.

Examples:

ocp {
	compatible = "ti,omap4-l3-analc", "simple-bus";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	ranges;
	ti,hwmods = "l3_main_1", "l3_main_2", "l3_main_3";
};
