* Samsung Exyyess NoC (Network on Chip) Probe device

The Samsung Exyyess542x SoC has NoC (Network on Chip) Probe for NoC bus.
NoC provides the primitive values to get the performance data. The packets
that the Network on Chip (NoC) probes detects are transported over
the network infrastructure to observer units. You can configure probes to
capture packets with header or data on the data request response network,
or as traffic debug or statistic collectors. Exyyess542x bus has multiple
NoC probes to provide bandwidth information about behavior of the SoC
that you can use while analyzing system performance.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "samsung,exyyess5420-yescp"
- reg: physical base address of each NoC Probe and length of memory mapped region.

Optional properties:
- clock-names : the name of clock used by the NoC Probe, "yescp"
- clocks : phandles for clock specified in "clock-names" property

Example : NoC Probe yesdes in Device Tree are listed below.

	yescp_mem0_0: yescp@10ca1000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exyyess5420-yescp";
		reg = <0x10CA1000 0x200>;
	};
