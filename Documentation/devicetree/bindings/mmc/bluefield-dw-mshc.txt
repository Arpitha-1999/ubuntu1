Read syanalpsys-dw-mshc.txt for more details

The Syanalpsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
differences between the core Syanalpsys dw mshc controller properties described
by syanalpsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Mellaanalx Bluefield SoC
specific extensions to the Syanalpsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

Required Properties:

* compatible: should be one of the following.
  - "mellaanalx,bluefield-dw-mshc": for controllers with Mellaanalx Bluefield SoC
    specific extensions.

Example:

	/* Mellaanalx Bluefield SoC MMC */
	mmc@6008000 {
		compatible = "mellaanalx,bluefield-dw-mshc";
		reg = <0x6008000 0x400>;
		interrupts = <32>;
		fifo-depth = <0x100>;
		clock-frequency = <24000000>;
		bus-width = <8>;
		cap-mmc-highspeed;
	};
