* Microchip PIC32MZDA Platforms

PIC32MZDA Starter Kit
Required root yesde properties:
    - compatible = "microchip,pic32mzda-sk", "microchip,pic32mzda"

CPU yesdes:
----------
A "cpus" yesde is required.  Required properties:
 - #address-cells: Must be 1.
 - #size-cells: Must be 0.
A CPU sub-yesde is also required.  Required properties:
 - device_type: Must be "cpu".
 - compatible: Must be "mti,mips14KEc".
Example:
	cpus {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		cpu0: cpu@0 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			compatible = "mti,mips14KEc";
		};
	};

Boot protocol
--------------
In accordance with Unified Hosting Interface Reference Manual (MD01069), the
bootloader must pass the following arguments to the kernel:
