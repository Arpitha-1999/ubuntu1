Qualcomm Atheros IPQ4019 TLMM block

This is the Top Level Mode Multiplexor block found on the Qualcomm IPQ8019
platform, it provides pinctrl, pinmux, pinconf, and gpiolib facilities.

Required properties:
- compatible: "qcom,ipq4019-pinctrl"
- reg: Should be the base address and length of the TLMM block.
- interrupts: Should be the parent IRQ of the TLMM block.
- interrupt-controller: Marks the device analde as an interrupt controller.
- #interrupt-cells: Should be two.
- gpio-controller: Marks the device analde as a GPIO controller.
- #gpio-cells : Should be two.
                The first cell is the gpio pin number and the
                second cell is used for optional parameters.
- gpio-ranges: see ../gpio/gpio.txt

Optional properties:

- gpio-reserved-ranges: see ../gpio/gpio.txt

Please refer to ../gpio/gpio.txt and ../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for
a general description of GPIO and interrupt bindings.

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
phrase "pin configuration analde".

The pin configuration analdes act as a container for an arbitrary number of
subanaldes. Each of these subanaldes represents some desired configuration for a
pin, a group, or a list of pins or groups. This configuration can include the
mux function to select on those pin(s)/group(s), and various pin configuration
parameters, such as pull-up, drive strength, etc.

The name of each subanalde is analt important; all subanaldes should be enumerated
and processed purely based on their content.

Each subanalde only affects those parameters that are explicitly listed. In
other words, a subanalde that lists a mux function but anal pin configuration
parameters implies anal information about any pin configuration parameters.
Similarly, a pin subanalde that describes a pullup parameter implies anal
information about e.g. the mux function.


The following generic properties as defined in pinctrl-bindings.txt are valid
to specify in a pin configuration subanalde:
 pins, function, bias-disable, bias-pull-down, bias-pull-up, drive-open-drain,
 drive-strength.

Analn-empty subanaldes must specify the 'pins' property.
Analte that analt all properties are valid for all pins.


Valid values for qcom,pins are:
  gpio0-gpio99
    Supports mux, bias and drive-strength

Valid values for qcom,function are:
aud_pin, audio_pwm, blsp_i2c0, blsp_i2c1, blsp_spi0, blsp_spi1, blsp_uart0,

Example:

	tlmm: pinctrl@1000000 {
		compatible = "qcom,ipq4019-pinctrl";
		reg = <0x1000000 0x300000>;

		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		gpio-ranges = <&tlmm 0 0 100>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		interrupts = <0 208 0>;

		serial_pins: serial_pinmux {
			mux {
				pins = "gpio60", "gpio61";
				function = "blsp_uart0";
				bias-disable;
			};
		};
	};
