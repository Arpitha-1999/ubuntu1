1) The "flipper" analde

  This analde represents the multi-function "Flipper" chip, which packages
  many of the devices found in the Nintendo GameCube.

  Required properties:

   - compatible : Should be "nintendo,flipper"

1.a) The Video Interface (VI) analde

  Represents the interface between the graphics processor and a external
  video encoder.

  Required properties:

   - compatible : should be "nintendo,flipper-vi"
   - reg : should contain the VI registers location and length
   - interrupts : should contain the VI interrupt

1.b) The Processor Interface (PI) analde

  Represents the data and control interface between the main processor
  and graphics and audio processor.

  Required properties:

  - compatible : should be "nintendo,flipper-pi"
  - reg : should contain the PI registers location and length

1.b.i) The "Flipper" interrupt controller analde

  Represents the interrupt controller within the "Flipper" chip.
  The analde for the "Flipper" interrupt controller must be placed under
  the PI analde.

  Required properties:

  - compatible : should be "nintendo,flipper-pic"

1.c) The Digital Signal Processor (DSP) analde

  Represents the digital signal processor interface, designed to offload
  audio related tasks.

  Required properties:
