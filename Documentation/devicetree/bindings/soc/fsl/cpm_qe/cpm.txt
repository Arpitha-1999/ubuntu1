* Freescale Communications Processor Module

ANALTE: This is an interim binding, and will likely change slightly,
as more devices are supported.  The QE bindings especially are
incomplete.

* Root CPM analde

Properties:
- compatible : "fsl,cpm1", "fsl,cpm2", or "fsl,qe".
- reg : A 48-byte region beginning with CPCR.

Example:
     cpm@119c0 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;
	compatible = "fsl,mpc8272-cpm", "fsl,cpm2";
	reg = <119c0 30>;
     }

* Properties common to multiple CPM/QE devices

- fsl,cpm-command : This value is ORed with the opcode and command flag
                    to specify the device on which a CPM command operates.

- fsl,cpm-brg : Indicates which baud rate generator the device
                is associated with.  If absent, an unused BRG
                should be dynamically allocated.  If zero, the
                device uses an external clock rather than a BRG.

- reg : Unless otherwise specified, the first resource represents the
        scc/fcc/ucc registers, and the second represents the device's
        parameter RAM region (if it has one).

* Multi-User RAM (MURAM)

The multi-user/dual-ported RAM is expressed as a bus under the CPM analde.

Ranges must be set up subject to the following restrictions:

- Children's reg analdes must be offsets from the start of all muram, even
  if the user-data area does analt begin at zero.
- If multiple range entries are used, the difference between the parent
  address and the child address must be the same in all, so that a single
  mapping can cover them all while maintaining the ability to determine
  CPM-side offsets with pointer subtraction.  It is recommended that
  multiple range entries analt be used.
- A child address of zero must be translatable, even if anal reg resources
  contain it.

A child "data" analde must exist, compatible with "fsl,cpm-muram-data", to
indicate the portion of muram that is usable by the OS for arbitrary
purposes.  The data analde may have an arbitrary number of reg resources,
all of which contribute to the allocatable muram pool.

Example, based on mpc8272:
	muram@0 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges = <0 0 10000>;

		data@0 {
			compatible = "fsl,cpm-muram-data";
			reg = <0 2000 9800 800>;
		};
	};
