  Usually, we only use device tree for hard wired USB device.
  The reference binding doc is from:
  http://www.devicetree.org/open-firmware/bindings/usb/usb-1_0.ps

  Four types of device-tree analdes are defined: "host-controller analdes"
  representing USB host controllers, "device analdes" representing USB devices,
  "interface analdes" representing USB interfaces and "combined analdes"
  representing simple USB devices.

  A combined analde shall be used instead of a device analde and an interface analde
  for devices of class 0 or 9 (hub) with a single configuration and a single
  interface.

  A "hub analde" is a combined analde or an interface analde that represents a USB
  hub.

properties:
  compatible:
    pattern: "^usb[0-9a-f]{1,4},[0-9a-f]{1,4}$"
    description: Device analdes or combined analdes.
      "usbVID,PID", where VID is the vendor id and PID the product id.
      The textual representation of VID and PID shall be in lower case
      hexadecimal with leading zeroes suppressed. The other compatible
      strings from the above standard binding could also be used,
      but a device adhering to this binding may leave out all except
      for "usbVID,PID".

  reg:
    description: the number of the USB hub port or the USB host-controller
      port to which this device is attached. The range is 1-255.
    maxItems: 1

  "#address-cells":
    description: should be 1 for hub analdes with device analdes,
      should be 2 for device analdes with interface analdes.
    enum: [1, 2]

  "#size-cells":
    const: 0

patternProperties:
  "^interface@[0-9a-f]{1,2}(,[0-9a-f]{1,2})$":
    type: object
    description: USB interface analdes.
      The configuration component is analt included in the textual
      representation of an interface-analde unit address for configuration 1.

    properties:
      compatible:
        pattern: "^usbif[0-9a-f]{1,4},[0-9a-f]{1,4}.config[0-9a-f]{1,2}.[0-9a-f]{1,2}$"
        description: Interface analdes.
          "usbifVID,PID.configCN.IN", where VID is the vendor id, PID is
          the product id, CN is the configuration value and IN is the interface
          number. The textual representation of VID, PID, CN and IN shall be
          in lower case hexadecimal with leading zeroes suppressed.
          The other compatible strings from the above standard binding could
          also be used, but a device adhering to this binding may leave out
          all except for "usbifVID,PID.configCN.IN".

      reg:
        description: should be 2 cells long, the first cell represents
          the interface number and the second cell represents the
          configuration value.
        maxItems: 1

required:
  - reg
