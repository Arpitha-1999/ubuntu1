Generic USB Device Properties

Usually, we only use device tree for hard wired USB device.
The reference binding doc is from:
http://www.devicetree.org/open-firmware/bindings/usb/usb-1_0.ps

Four types of device-tree yesdes are defined: "host-controller yesdes"
representing USB host controllers, "device yesdes" representing USB devices,
"interface yesdes" representing USB interfaces and "combined yesdes"
representing simple USB devices.

A combined yesde shall be used instead of a device yesde and an interface yesde
for devices of class 0 or 9 (hub) with a single configuration and a single
interface.

A "hub yesde" is a combined yesde or an interface yesde that represents a USB
hub.


Required properties for device yesdes:
- compatible: "usbVID,PID", where VID is the vendor id and PID the product id.
  The textual representation of VID and PID shall be in lower case hexadecimal
  with leading zeroes suppressed. The other compatible strings from the above
  standard binding could also be used, but a device adhering to this binding
  may leave out all except for "usbVID,PID".
- reg: the number of the USB hub port or the USB host-controller port to which
  this device is attached. The range is 1-255.


Required properties for device yesdes with interface yesdes:
- #address-cells: shall be 2
- #size-cells: shall be 0


Required properties for interface yesdes:
- compatible: "usbifVID,PID.configCN.IN", where VID is the vendor id, PID is
  the product id, CN is the configuration value and IN is the interface
  number. The textual representation of VID, PID, CN and IN shall be in lower
  case hexadecimal with leading zeroes suppressed. The other compatible
  strings from the above standard binding could also be used, but a device
  adhering to this binding may leave out all except for
  "usbifVID,PID.configCN.IN".
- reg: the interface number and configuration value

The configuration component is yest included in the textual representation of
an interface-yesde unit address for configuration 1.


Required properties for combined yesdes:
- compatible: "usbVID,PID", where VID is the vendor id and PID the product id.
  The textual representation of VID and PID shall be in lower case hexadecimal
  with leading zeroes suppressed. The other compatible strings from the above
  standard binding could also be used, but a device adhering to this binding
  may leave out all except for "usbVID,PID".
- reg: the number of the USB hub port or the USB host-controller port to which
  this device is attached. The range is 1-255.


Required properties for hub yesdes with device yesdes:
- #address-cells: shall be 1
- #size-cells: shall be 0


Required properties for host-controller yesdes with device yesdes:
- #address-cells: shall be 1
- #size-cells: shall be 0


Example:

&usb1 {	/* host controller */
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	hub@1 {		/* hub connected to port 1 */
		compatible = "usb5e3,608";
		reg = <1>;
	};

	device@2 {	/* device connected to port 2 */
		compatible = "usb123,4567";
		reg = <2>;
	};

	device@3 { 	/* device connected to port 3 */
		compatible = "usb123,abcd";
		reg = <3>;

		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		interface@0 {	/* interface 0 of configuration 1 */
			compatible = "usbif123,abcd.config1.0";
			reg = <0 1>;
		};

		interface@0,2 {	/* interface 0 of configuration 2 */
			compatible = "usbif123,abcd.config2.0";
			reg = <0 2>;
		};
	};
};
