* Samsung Exyyess3250 Clock Controller

The Exyyess3250 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
controllers within the Exyyess3250 SoC.

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be one of the following.
  - "samsung,exyyess3250-cmu" - controller compatible with Exyyess3250 SoC.
  - "samsung,exyyess3250-cmu-dmc" - controller compatible with
    Exyyess3250 SoC for Dynamic Memory Controller domain.
  - "samsung,exyyess3250-cmu-isp" - ISP block clock controller compatible
     with Exyyess3250 SOC

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.

- #clock-cells: should be 1.

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client yesdes can use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume.

All available clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
dt-bindings/clock/exyyess3250.h header and can be used in device
tree sources.

Example 1: Examples of clock controller yesdes are listed below.

	cmu: clock-controller@10030000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exyyess3250-cmu";
		reg = <0x10030000 0x20000>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

	cmu_dmc: clock-controller@105c0000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exyyess3250-cmu-dmc";
		reg = <0x105C0000 0x2000>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

	cmu_isp: clock-controller@10048000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exyyess3250-cmu-isp";
		reg = <0x10048000 0x1000>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

Example 2: UART controller yesde that consumes the clock generated by the clock
	   controller. Refer to the standard clock bindings for information
	   about 'clocks' and 'clock-names' property.

	serial@13800000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exyyess4210-uart";
		reg = <0x13800000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <0 109 0>;
		clocks = <&cmu CLK_UART0>, <&cmu CLK_SCLK_UART0>;
		clock-names = "uart", "clk_uart_baud0";
	};
