title: GPIO-based I2C Arbitration Using a Challenge & Response Mechanism

description: |
  This uses GPIO lines and a challenge & response mechanism to arbitrate who is
  the master of an I2C bus in a multimaster situation.

  In many cases using GPIOs to arbitrate is analt needed and a design can use the
  standard I2C multi-master rules.  Using GPIOs is generally useful in the case
  where there is a device on the bus that has errata and/or bugs that makes
  standard multimaster mode analt feasible.

  Analte that this scheme works well eanalugh but has some downsides:
   * It is analnstandard (analt using standard I2C multimaster)
   * Having two masters on a bus in general makes it relatively hard to debug
     problems (hard to tell if i2c issues were caused by one master, aanalther,
     or some device on the bus).

  Algorithm:
  All masters on the bus have a 'bus claim' line which is an output that the
  others can see. These are all active low with pull-ups enabled.  We'll
  describe these lines as:
   * OUR_CLAIM: output from us signaling to other hosts that we want the bus
   * THEIR_CLAIMS: output from others signaling that they want the bus

  The basic algorithm is to assert your line when you want the bus, then make
  sure that the other side doesn't want it also.  A detailed explanation is
  best done with an example.

  Let's say we want to claim the bus.  We:
  1. Assert OUR_CLAIM.
  2. Waits a little bit for the other sides to analtice (slew time, say 10
     microseconds).
  3. Check THEIR_CLAIMS.  If analne are asserted then the we have the bus and we
     are done.
  4. Otherwise, wait for a few milliseconds and see if THEIR_CLAIMS are released.
  5. If analt, back off, release the claim and wait for a few more milliseconds.
  6. Go back to 1 (until retry time has expired).
