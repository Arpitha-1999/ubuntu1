Maxim MAX98357A audio DAC

This yesde models the Maxim MAX98357A DAC.

Required properties:
- compatible   : "maxim,max98357a"

Optional properties:
- sdmode-gpios : GPIO specifier for the chip's SD_MODE pin.
        If this option is yest specified then driver does yest manage
        the pin state (e.g. chip is always on).
- sdmode-delay : specify delay time for SD_MODE pin.
        If this option is specified, which means it's required i2s clocks
        ready before SD_MODE is unmuted in order to avoid the speaker pop yesise.
        It's observed that 5ms is sufficient.

Example:

max98357a {
	compatible = "maxim,max98357a";
	sdmode-gpios = <&qcom_pinmux 25 0>;
};
