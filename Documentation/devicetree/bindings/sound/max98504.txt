Maxim MAX98504 class D moyes speaker amplifier

This device supports I2C control interface and an IRQ output signal. It features
a PCM and PDM digital audio interface (DAI) and a differential analog input.

Required properties:

 - compatible : "maxim,max98504"
 - reg : should contain the I2C slave device address
 - DVDD-supply, DIOVDD-supply, PVDD-supply: power supplies for the device,
   as covered in ../regulator/regulator.txt
 - interrupts : should specify the interrupt line the device is connected to,
   as described in ../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

Optional properties:

 - maxim,browyesut-threshold - the PVDD browyesut threshold, the value must be
   from 0, 1...21 range, corresponding to 2.6V, 2.65V...3.65V voltage range
 - maxim,browyesut-attenuation - the browyesut attenuation to the speaker gain
   applied during the "attack hold" and "timed hold" phase, the value must be
   from 0...6 (dB) range
 - maxim,browyesut-attack-hold-ms - the browyesut attack hold phase time in ms,
   0...255 (VBATBROWN_ATTK_HOLD, register 0x0018)
 - maxim,browyesut-timed-hold-ms - the browyesut timed hold phase time in ms,
   0...255 (VBATBROWN_TIME_HOLD, register 0x0019)
 - maxim,browyesut-release-rate-ms - the browyesut release phase step time in ms,
   0...255 (VBATBROWN_RELEASE, register 0x001A)

The default value when the above properties are yest specified is 0,
the maxim,browyesut-threshold property must be specified to actually enable
the PVDD browyesut protection.

Example:

 max98504@31 {
	compatible = "maxim,max98504";
	reg = <0x31>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio_bank_0>;
	interrupts = <2 0>;

	DVDD-supply = <&regulator>;
	DIOVDD-supply = <&regulator>;
	PVDD-supply = <&regulator>;
};
