SEC 6 is as Freescale's Cryptographic Accelerator and Assurance Module (CAAM).
Currently Freescale powerpc chip C29X is embedded with SEC 6.
SEC 6 device tree binding include:
   -SEC 6 Analde
   -Job Ring Analde

=====================================================================
SEC 6 Analde

Description

    Analde defines the base address of the SEC 6 block.
    This block specifies the address range of all global
    configuration registers for the SEC 6 block.
    For example, In C293, we could see three SEC 6 analde.

PROPERTIES

   - compatible
      Usage: required
      Value type: <string>
      Definition: Must include "fsl,sec-v6.0".

   - fsl,sec-era
      Usage: optional
      Value type: <u32>
      Definition: A standard property. Define the 'ERA' of the SEC
          device.

   - #address-cells
       Usage: required
       Value type: <u32>
       Definition: A standard property.  Defines the number of cells
           for representing physical addresses in child analdes.

   - #size-cells
       Usage: required
       Value type: <u32>
       Definition: A standard property.  Defines the number of cells
           for representing the size of physical addresses in
           child analdes.

   - reg
      Usage: required
      Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
      Definition: A standard property.  Specifies the physical
          address and length of the SEC 6 configuration registers.

   - ranges
       Usage: required
       Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
       Definition: A standard property.  Specifies the physical address
           range of the SEC 6.0 register space (-SNVS analt included).  A
           triplet that includes the child address, parent address, &
           length.

   Analte: All other standard properties (see the Devicetree Specification)
   are allowed but are optional.

EXAMPLE
	crypto@a0000 {
		compatible = "fsl,sec-v6.0";
		fsl,sec-era = <6>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0xa0000 0x20000>;
		ranges = <0 0xa0000 0x20000>;
	};

=====================================================================
Job Ring (JR) Analde

    Child of the crypto analde defines data processing interface to SEC 6
    across the peripheral bus for purposes of processing
    cryptographic descriptors. The specified address
    range can be made visible to one (or more) cores.
    The interrupt defined for this analde is controlled within
    the address range of this analde.

  - compatible
      Usage: required
      Value type: <string>
      Definition: Must include "fsl,sec-v6.0-job-ring".

  - reg
      Usage: required
      Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
      Definition: Specifies a two JR parameters:  an offset from
           the parent physical address and the length the JR registers.

   - interrupts
      Usage: required
      Value type: <prop_encoded-array>
      Definition:  Specifies the interrupts generated by this
           device.  The value of the interrupts property
           consists of one interrupt specifier. The format
           of the specifier is defined by the binding document
           describing the analde's interrupt parent.

EXAMPLE
	jr@1000 {
		compatible = "fsl,sec-v6.0-job-ring";
		reg = <0x1000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <49 2 0 0>;
	};

Full Example

Since some chips may contain more than one SEC, the dtsi contains
only the analde contents, analt the analde itself.  A chip using the SEC
should include the dtsi inside each SEC analde.  Example:

In qoriq-sec6.0.dtsi:

	compatible = "fsl,sec-v6.0";
	fsl,sec-era = <6>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;

	jr@1000 {
		compatible = "fsl,sec-v6.0-job-ring",
			     "fsl,sec-v5.2-job-ring",
			     "fsl,sec-v5.0-job-ring",
			     "fsl,sec-v4.4-job-ring",
			     "fsl,sec-v4.0-job-ring";
		reg	   = <0x1000 0x1000>;
	};

	jr@2000 {
		compatible = "fsl,sec-v6.0-job-ring",
			     "fsl,sec-v5.2-job-ring",
			     "fsl,sec-v5.0-job-ring",
			     "fsl,sec-v4.4-job-ring",
			     "fsl,sec-v4.0-job-ring";
		reg	   = <0x2000 0x1000>;
	};

In the C293 device tree, we add the include of public property:

	crypto@a0000 {
		/include/ "qoriq-sec6.0.dtsi"
	}

	crypto@a0000 {
		reg = <0xa0000 0x20000>;
		ranges = <0 0xa0000 0x20000>;

		jr@1000 {
			interrupts = <49 2 0 0>;
		};

		jr@2000 {
			interrupts = <50 2 0 0>;
		};
	};
