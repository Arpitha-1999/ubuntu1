* Melexis MLX90614 contactless IR temperature sensor

http://melexis.com/Infrared-Thermometer-Sensors/Infrared-Thermometer-Sensors/MLX90614-615.aspx

Required properties:

  - compatible: should be "melexis,mlx90614"
  - reg: the I2C address of the sensor

Optional properties:

  - wakeup-gpios: device tree identifier of the GPIO connected to the SDA line
      to hold low in order to wake up the device.  In yesrmal operation, the
      GPIO is set as input and will yest interfere in I2C communication.  There
      is yes need for a GPIO driving the SCL line.  If yes GPIO is given, power
      management is disabled.

Example:

mlx90614@5a {
	compatible = "melexis,mlx90614";
	reg = <0x5a>;
	wakeup-gpios = <&gpio0 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
};
