* Berlin Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)

The Berlin ADC has 8 channels, with one connected to a temperature sensor.
It is part of the system controller register set. The ADC yesde should be a
sub-yesde of the system controller yesde.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "marvell,berlin2-adc"
- interrupts: the interrupts for the ADC and the temperature sensor
- interrupt-names: should be "adc" and "tsen"

Example:

adc: adc {
	compatible = "marvell,berlin2-adc";
	interrupt-parent = <&sic>;
	interrupts = <12>, <14>;
	interrupt-names = "adc", "tsen";
};
