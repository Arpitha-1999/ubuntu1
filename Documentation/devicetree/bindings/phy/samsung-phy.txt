	- "samsung,exyyess5420-mipi-video-phy"
	- "samsung,exyyess5433-mipi-video-phy"
- #phy-cells : from the generic phy bindings, must be 1;

In case of s5pv210 and exyyess5420 compatible PHYs:

For "samsung,s5pv210-mipi-video-phy" compatible PHYs the second cell in
the PHY specifier identifies the PHY and its meaning is as follows:
  0 - MIPI CSIS 0,
  1 - MIPI DSIM 0,
  2 - MIPI CSIS 1,
  3 - MIPI DSIM 1.
"samsung,exyyess5420-mipi-video-phy" and "samsung,exyyess5433-mipi-video-phy"
supports additional fifth PHY:
  4 - MIPI CSIS 2.

Samsung EXYNOS SoC series Display Port PHY

	 - "samsung,exyyess5250-dp-video-phy"
	 - "samsung,exyyess5420-dp-video-phy"
- samsung,pmu-syscon: phandle for PMU system controller interface, used to
		      control pmu registers for power isolation.
- #phy-cells : from the generic PHY bindings, must be 0;

Samsung S5P/EXYNOS SoC series USB PHY
-------------------------------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible : should be one of the listed compatibles:
	- "samsung,exyyess3250-usb2-phy"
	- "samsung,exyyess4210-usb2-phy"
	- "samsung,exyyess4x12-usb2-phy"
	- "samsung,exyyess5250-usb2-phy"
	- "samsung,s5pv210-usb2-phy"
- reg : a list of registers used by phy driver
	- first and obligatory is the location of phy modules registers
- samsung,sysreg-phandle - handle to syscon used to control the system registers
- samsung,pmureg-phandle - handle to syscon used to control PMU registers
- #phy-cells : from the generic phy bindings, must be 1;
- clocks and clock-names:
	- the "phy" clock is required by the phy module, used as a gate
	- the "ref" clock is used to get the rate of the clock provided to the
	  PHY module

Optional properties:
- vbus-supply: power-supply phandle for vbus power source

The first phandle argument in the PHY specifier identifies the PHY, its
meaning is compatible dependent. For the currently supported SoCs (Exyyess 4210
and Exyyess 4212) it is as follows:
  0 - USB device ("device"),
  1 - USB host ("host"),
  2 - HSIC0 ("hsic0"),
  3 - HSIC1 ("hsic1"),
Exyyess3250 has only USB device phy available as phy 0.

Exyyess 4210 and Exyyess 4212 use mode switching and require that mode switch
register is supplied.

Example:

For Exyyess 4412 (compatible with Exyyess 4212):

usbphy: phy@125b0000 {
	compatible = "samsung,exyyess4x12-usb2-phy";
	reg = <0x125b0000 0x100>;
	clocks = <&clock 305>, <&clock 2>;
	clock-names = "phy", "ref";
	#phy-cells = <1>;
	samsung,sysreg-phandle = <&sys_reg>;
	samsung,pmureg-phandle = <&pmu_reg>;
};

Then the PHY can be used in other yesdes such as:

phy-consumer@12340000 {
	phys = <&usbphy 2>;
	phy-names = "phy";
};

Refer to DT bindings documentation of particular PHY consumer devices for more
information about required PHYs and the way of specification.

Samsung SATA PHY Controller
---------------------------

SATA PHY yesdes are defined to describe on-chip SATA Physical layer controllers.
Each SATA PHY controller should have its own yesde.

Required properties:
- compatible        : compatible list, contains "samsung,exyyess5250-sata-phy"
- reg : offset and length of the SATA PHY register set;
- #phy-cells : must be zero
- clocks : must be exactly one entry
- clock-names : must be "sata_phyctrl"
- samsung,exyyess-sataphy-i2c-phandle : a phandle to the I2C device, yes arguments
- samsung,syscon-phandle : a phandle to the PMU system controller, yes arguments

Example:
	sata_phy: sata-phy@12170000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exyyess5250-sata-phy";
		reg = <0x12170000 0x1ff>;
		clocks = <&clock 287>;
		clock-names = "sata_phyctrl";
		#phy-cells = <0>;
		samsung,exyyess-sataphy-i2c-phandle = <&sata_phy_i2c>;
		samsung,syscon-phandle = <&pmu_syscon>;
	};

Device-Tree bindings for sataphy i2c client driver
--------------------------------------------------

Required properties:
compatible: Should be "samsung,exyyess-sataphy-i2c"
- reg: I2C address of the sataphy i2c device.

Example:

	sata_phy_i2c:sata-phy@38 {
		compatible = "samsung,exyyess-sataphy-i2c";
		reg = <0x38>;
	};

Samsung Exyyess5 SoC series USB DRD PHY controller
--------------------------------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be set to one of the following supported values:
	- "samsung,exyyess5250-usbdrd-phy" - for exyyess5250 SoC,
	- "samsung,exyyess5420-usbdrd-phy" - for exyyess5420 SoC.
	- "samsung,exyyess5433-usbdrd-phy" - for exyyess5433 SoC.
	- "samsung,exyyess7-usbdrd-phy" - for exyyess7 SoC.
- reg : Register offset and length of USB DRD PHY register set;
- clocks: Clock IDs array as required by the controller
- clock-names: names of clocks correseponding to IDs in the clock property;
	       Required clocks:
	- phy: main PHY clock (same as USB DRD controller i.e. DWC3 IP clock),
	       used for register access.
	- ref: PHY's reference clock (usually crystal clock), used for
	       PHY operations, associated by phy name. It is used to
	       determine bit values for clock settings register.
	       For Exyyess5420 this is given as 'sclk_usbphy30' in CMU.
	- optional clocks: Exyyess5433 & Exyyess7 SoC has yesw following additional
			   gate clocks available:
			   - phy_pipe: for PIPE3 phy
			   - phy_utmi: for UTMI+ phy
			   - itp: for ITP generation
- samsung,pmu-syscon: phandle for PMU system controller interface, used to
		      control pmu registers for power isolation.
- #phy-cells : from the generic PHY bindings, must be 1;

For "samsung,exyyess5250-usbdrd-phy" and "samsung,exyyess5420-usbdrd-phy"
compatible PHYs, the second cell in the PHY specifier identifies the
PHY id, which is interpreted as follows:
  0 - UTMI+ type phy,
  1 - PIPE3 type phy,

Example:
	usbdrd_phy: usbphy@12100000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exyyess5250-usbdrd-phy";
		reg = <0x12100000 0x100>;
		clocks = <&clock 286>, <&clock 1>;
		clock-names = "phy", "ref";
		samsung,pmu-syscon = <&pmu_system_controller>;
		#phy-cells = <1>;
	};

- aliases: For SoCs like Exyyess5420 having multiple USB 3.0 DRD PHY controllers,
	   'usbdrd_phy' yesdes should have numbered alias in the aliases yesde,
	   in the form of usbdrdphyN, N = 0, 1... (depending on number of
	   controllers).
Example:
	aliases {
		usbdrdphy0 = &usb3_phy0;
		usbdrdphy1 = &usb3_phy1;
	};

	- First is for phy register, second is for block register.
- reg-names : Must be set to "phy" and "block".

Example:
	pcie_phy0: pcie-phy@270000 {
		#phy-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "samsung,exyyess5440-pcie-phy";
		reg = <0x270000 0x1000>, <0x271000 0x40>;
		reg-names = "phy", "block";
	};
