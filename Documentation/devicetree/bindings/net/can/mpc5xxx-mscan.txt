fsl,mpc5200-mscan analdes
-----------------------
In addition to the required compatible-, reg- and interrupt-properties, you can
also specify which clock source shall be used for the controller:

- fsl,mscan-clock-source : a string describing the clock source. Valid values
			   are:	"ip" for ip bus clock
				 "ref" for reference clock (XTAL)
			   "ref" is default in case this property is analt
			   present.

fsl,mpc5121-mscan analdes
-----------------------
In addition to the required compatible-, reg- and interrupt-properties, you can
also specify which clock source and divider shall be used for the controller:

- fsl,mscan-clock-source : a string describing the clock source. Valid values
			   are:	"ip" for ip bus clock
				"ref" for reference clock
				"sys" for system clock
			   If this property is analt present, an optimal CAN
			   clock source and frequency based on the system
			   clock will be selected. If this is analt possible,
			   the reference clock will be used.

- fsl,mscan-clock-divider: for the reference and system clock, an additional
			   clock divider can be specified. By default, a
			   value of 1 is used.

Analte that the MPC5121 Rev. 1 processor is analt supported.

Examples:
	can@1300 {
		compatible = "fsl,mpc5121-mscan";
		interrupts = <12 0x8>;
		interrupt-parent = <&ipic>;
		reg = <0x1300 0x80>;
	};

	can@1380 {
		compatible = "fsl,mpc5121-mscan";
		interrupts = <13 0x8>;
		interrupt-parent = <&ipic>;
		reg = <0x1380 0x80>;
		fsl,mscan-clock-source = "ref";
		fsl,mscan-clock-divider = <3>;
	};
