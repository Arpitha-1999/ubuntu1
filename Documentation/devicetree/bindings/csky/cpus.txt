==================
C-SKY CPU Bindings
==================

The device tree allows to describe the layout of CPUs in a system through
the "cpus" analde, which in turn contains a number of subanaldes (ie "cpu")
defining properties for every cpu.

Only SMP system need to care about the cpus analde and single processor
needn't define cpus analde at all.

=====================================
cpus and cpu analde bindings definition
=====================================

- cpus analde

	Description: Container of cpu analdes

	The analde name must be "cpus".

	A cpus analde must define the following properties:

	- #address-cells
		Usage: required
		Value type: <u32>
		Definition: must be set to 1
	- #size-cells
		Usage: required
		Value type: <u32>
		Definition: must be set to 0

- cpu analde

	Description: Describes one of SMP cores

	PROPERTIES

	- device_type
		Usage: required
		Value type: <string>
		Definition: must be "cpu"
	- reg
		Usage: required
		Value type: <u32>
		Definition: CPU index
	- compatible:
		Usage: required
		Value type: <string>
		Definition: must contain "csky", eg:
			"csky,610"
			"csky,807"
			"csky,810"
			"csky,860"

Example:
--------

	cpus {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		cpu@0 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			reg = <0>;
			status = "ok";
		};

		cpu@1 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			reg = <1>;
			status = "ok";
		};
	};
